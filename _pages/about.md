Before pursuing PhD, I got my master degree from [School of Aeronautics](http://hangkong.nwpu.edu.cn/), [Northwestern Polytechnical University](http://www.nwpu.edu.cn/), Xi'an, China in 2023, supervised by [Prof. Yongbo Li](https://teacher.nwpu.edu.cn/8FA4308A7D6048AA9C1C6F7AFA7D9225.html). I received the B.Eng. degree in Aircraft Control and Information Engineering from Northwestern Polytechnical University in 2020.  

My research interest includes:
